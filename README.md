# UTN Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the Uppsala Union of Engineering and Science Students (UTN) IT infrastructure. Our goal is to provide a centralized resource detailing all digital systems and activities within UTN, such as the main website, email services, and individual section websites.

Access the published documentation at: [docs.utn.se](https://docs.utn.se/introduction/).

## Set Up

To get started, clone the repository using `git clone --recursive link_to_this_repository`.

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). Once Hugo is installed, simply run `hugo` in the project directory to generate HTML files in the `public/` folder, which are then ready for website deployment.

For development convenience, use `hugo server` to start a local web server that reflects live changes as you work.

## Get Involved

Contributions are highly encouraged! If you notice areas for improvement or want to enhance the documentation, please submit an issue or a pull request.
