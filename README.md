# UTN Documentation

This documentation website aims to document the UTN IT infrastructure. It aims
to document all digital UTN systems and activities on a global level; for
example the website, the e-mail service, but also the websites of sections are
documented within this website.

The website is currently hosted on:
[docs.utn.se](https://docs.utn.se/introduction/).

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from everyone! So if you feel something should be
improved, then feel free to write an issue, or even to make a pull request.

## Installation

Clone the project with `git clone --recursive link`.

This website is generated using [Hugo](gohugo.io). If you have Hugo installed,
then it's a simple fact of running `hugo` within the directory. HTML files will
be generated in the `public/` directory. These files can then be used to host
the website.

Tip: while working on the website `hugo server` will host a local web server
which will automatically update when changes are made.
