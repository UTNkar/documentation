The "Education" menu tab is dedicated to managing the various education programs and sections. If the university introduces a new study program or renames an existing one, or if the Union establishes a new section or renames one, you may need to update this information in the system.

The "Education" tab has two sub-menus: "Sections" and "Study program."

### Sections

The sections window displays all the sections that have been added. To create a new section, click "ADD SECTION." To modify a section, hover over it and select "EDIT." To remove a section, hover over it and click "DELETE."

In the "STUDIES" area, you select the study programs associated with the section. Ensure that all sections include "PhD studies" and "Stand alone courses" as options.

### Study Programs
