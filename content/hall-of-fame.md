Many System Administrators have had great teams helping them. These teams include software developers and designers who have worked hard too. We can't name everyone because there are so many people who have helped. If you helped with software or design, you can ask your project manager to write down what you did. This way, you can get credit for your work. UTN is really grateful for all the help from everyone. Your work has made a big difference. Thank you!
