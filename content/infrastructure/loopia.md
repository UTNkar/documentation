UTN registers its domain names at [Loopia](https://www.loopia.com). We currently
hold the following domain names:

- es20.se - Used by the ES section for their 20 year celebration. This domain is payed by the ES section.
- forsranningen.com
- forsranningen.se
- forsränningen.se
- karsamverkan.se
- kårsamverkan.se
- naturvetarbalen.se
- polhacks.se
- recce.se
- tdmottagningen.se
- utn.se
- utnarm.com
- utnarm.se

Most DNS entries are thus also managed at Loopia, except for *utn.se*, *utnarm.se* and *es20.se*
which are managed at [CloudFlare](/infrastructure/cloudflare). This means that the subdomain records for them
at loopia don't have any effect and don't work.
