UTN's e-mail is managed by Google Apps. Through this service, UTN workers can
use all of Google's services and share their use within the UTN organization.
The services that should be of particular interest to the UTN workers are the
following:

- [mail.utn.se](http://mail.utn.se/), the UTN mail-service - similar to GMail.
- [drive.utn.se](http://drive.utn.se/), the UTN file storage - similar to Google
Drive.
- [calendar.utn.se](http://calendar.utn.se/), the UTN calendar - similar to
Google Calendar.

As an admin of the Google Apps organization, you will be able to access the
settings of Google Apps through the [admin panel](https://admin.google.com),
login using your UTN account.

## Account Policy

Within UTN all members that acquire a position as an official for UTN are
allowed to have a Google Apps account. A Google Apps account allows the user to
have a "@utn.se" e-mail address and use 15 GB of memory for Google's cloud
services. However because of the limited number of accounts available, for the
sake of clarity in administration, and to keep the data available among the UTN
officials, the following policy is used to govern the Google Apps accounts.

The accounts for UTN are split in two categories: accounts that bound to a
specific position(e.g., *admin@utn.se*), and accounts that are bound to a
specific person (e.g., *jip.dekker@utn.se*). For each of these accounts a
different policy is in place.

### Position Bound Accounts

Position bound accounts are never deleted, whenever a new person enters the
position, the account is transferred to this person. It is up to the former
holder of the position to remove files, e-mails, and other data that is no
longer relevant or of a personal nature.

Should the former holder of a position require continued access to the Google
Apps account, a mutually agreeable temporary arrangement should be formed
between the people involved.

### Personal Accounts

Like position bound accounts, the availability of the personal accounts is to
the extent of the position(s) that that person holds within UTN. However, due to
fact that there is no need to use that specific account the transferring process
is a bit different compared to position bound accounts. Once a new person takes
over the position, the following steps are followed:

- A new account is created for the new UTN official.
- The former position holder will receive 2 weeks to perform cleanup tasks (more
or less time could be agreed upon with the information officer)
- The data of the personal account is transferred to the new account, and the
old account is deleted.
- An alias is added to the new account so no e-mail send to the old account will
be lost.

## Single Sign On

The Google Apps accounts can for various [Drupal-based](TODO:) applications be
used to authenticate. As of the current moment the way in which the settings are
arranged is working, but the settings themselves aren't accessible. The current
strategy is thus: *if it ain't broken, don't fix it*.
