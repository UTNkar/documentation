# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation website for the UTN IT systems.

For most UTN workers the first chapter will be the most important, but UTN
maintains an open documentation system so it can be beneficial for everyone. We
encourage everyone to contribute to the documentation using the "Edit this page"
links at the top of page, to help improve the quality and the coverage of the
documentation available.

For any information that is not available on this website, or is unclear,
contact the [system administrator](mailto:admin@utn.se).
