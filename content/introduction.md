Welcome to the documentation website for the UTN IT systems.

The first chapter is important for most UTN workers, but UTN promotes an open documentation system that may benefit all. We invite everyone to contribute to the documentation by using the "Edit this page" links at the top of each page. This helps to enhance the documentation's quality and breadth.

If you cannot find information on this website or if anything is unclear, please contact the [system administrator](mailto:admin@utn.se).
