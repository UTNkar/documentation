# OrdSys

These pages are about the digital order management system used during pub events.

OrdSys is a food- and beverage **ord**er management **sys**tem meant to remove the need for UTN bar staff writing orders on post-it notes, which often leads to longer waiting times and more mistakes.

In short, OrdSys allows users to crate food and drink orders (svenska: *bongar*) through a flexible web interface using a computer, phone or tablet. These orders are then sent to a kitchen or bar for handling, before ultimately being delivered to a customer either through carry-out or pick-up.
