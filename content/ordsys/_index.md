This chapter provides information about the digital order management system used at pub events.

OrdSys is a digital system designed to streamline the process of ordering food and beverages. It replaces the old method of writing orders on post-it notes, which can slow down service and increase the chances of errors.

**Key features of OrdSys include:**

- A user-friendly web interface that works on computers, phones, and tablets.
- The ability to quickly create and submit orders for food and drinks, which in Swedish are called *bongar*.
- Orders are electronically sent to the kitchen or bar staff for preparation.
- Customers can then either carry out their orders or pick them up when ready.
