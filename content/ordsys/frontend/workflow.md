OrdSys can adapt to various service scenarios, including a typical Thursday pub or a pub tent under Covid-19 restrictions. Below are examples of how the system functions in these different settings.

## Normal Workflow

Traditionally, OrdSys is used to manage only *food* orders during a pub night, as beverages are typically served immediately. The active views in this scenario are the *bar* and *kitchen*.

### 1. Placing an Order

At the bar, a customer orders a beer and a hamburger. The bar staff gives them a table number sign and the beer, then enters the hamburger order into OrdSys for the specified table number. The customer pays for the order before leaving the bar.

### 2. Receiving and Handling an Order

In the kitchen, staff see the incoming hamburger order on a screen displaying the kitchen view. When ready to prepare the order, they move it to the *in progress* column, signaling to the bar staff and avoiding duplicate efforts in the kitchen.

The kitchen view also shows a summary of pending items, allowing staff to inform the bar if an item runs out.

### 3. Fulfilling the Order

Once prepared, the kitchen staff move the burger to the *done* column. A staff member then delivers the burger to the customer's table using the table number sign. After delivery, the bar staff set the order as *delivered* in the bar view, removing it from the system.

## Covid-19 Workflow

The Covid-19 pandemic necessitated significant alterations to service, including tableside service by staff rather than customer visits to the bar.

Here's an example from the TD reception tent's pub nights:

### 1. Placing an Order

A waiter enters orders for a hamburger and a beer into a tablet within the waiter view, along with the table number. The system creates two separate orders to be handled by the kitchen and bar staff. The customer does not pay immediately.

### 2. Receiving and Handling an Order

The kitchen and bar each have a laptop showing the kitchen and tap views, respectively. They prepare the orders as in the standard workflow. When ready, they move the orders to the *done* column.

#### 3. Fulfilling the Order

Once the kitchen staff completes the preparation of the hamburger, they update its status in OrdSys. They do this by clicking the rightward-facing arrow on the order within the kitchen view, which moves it to the *done* column. This action alerts the bar staff that the food item is ready for delivery.

A staff member—either from the bar or kitchen—is assigned to deliver the completed orders to the customers. They locate the prepared hamburger, identify the correct table by matching the table number sign provided to the customer, and deliver the food directly to them.

After the delivery is confirmed, the bar staff or the delivering staff member is responsible for updating the order status in OrdSys. They access the bar view, locate the corresponding order, and mark it as *delivered*. This final step removes the order from the system's active view, ensuring the order management process is kept up-to-date and avoiding any confusion over pending orders. This process ensures that customers receive their orders in a timely manner while maintaining an organized and smooth operation during the pub night.
