Upon attempting to access the system, unauthenticated users are directed to the login screen, which is comprised of the following:

- A **drop-down list of organizations**: Select your organization from the list.
- A **drop-down list of users** within the selected organization: Choose your user account.
- A **password field**: Enter your password to gain access.

User accounts are under the jurisdiction of their respective organization's administrator, and details on account management can be found in the backend documentation.
