### Order Information Window

When you press on an order, an information window appears:

![order information modal](/images/ordsys/views/delivery-modal.png)

This window provides a clearer view of the order and includes functions to manage it. The top button will be labeled "claim" or "delivered" based on whether the order is ready to be carried out or has been completed. Press "claim" to mark the order as claimed, which indicates you are taking responsibility for its delivery. Once an order is claimed, the "deliver" button can be used to signify that the order has been delivered and remove it from the active list.

The delete button allows you to remove the order from the system entirely without impacting recorded statistics.

{{% notice tip %}}
To prevent confusion and ensure efficient delivery, claim an order when you are in the process of delivering it. This will signal to other staff that the order is being handled.
