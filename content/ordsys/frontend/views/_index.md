# The front-end user interface

This section describes the different user views in the front-end. The image below is a screenshot of the *index view*, which users are met with when accessing the system. From here, users can then navigate to whichever view they need to use for their respective duties. Each view has their own documentation page in the sidebar of this page.

Before the below view is seen, the user must first authenticate themselves through the [Login Screen](./login).

{{% notice tip %}}

Note that the logotype displayed in the upper-left corner (seen in all views) **can be pressed** to return to this index view. The logotype (as well as general theming) depends on what organisation the user logged in as.

{{% /notice %}}
