The statistics view is intended for managers in charge of food ordering and planning.

![statistics view](/images/ordsys/views/statistics.png)

The statistics view allows you to get an overview of how many of each menu item is ordered during a selected date and time interval (such as the previous night, or the full two weeks of a reception).

It will count all occurrences of each menu item in orders regardless of their status (except for deleted orders). To use the statistics view, select a start date & time as well as an end date & time using the date fields and hit the *load selected interval* button. This will display a bar chart, as seen in the above picture.
