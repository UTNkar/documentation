The tap view is intended to be displayed on either a tablet or a computer in areas with bar staff preparing drink orders.

![tap view](/images/ordsys/views/tap.png)

The tap view is functionally and visually identical to the [kitchen view](../kitchen), the only difference being that beverage orders are displayed instead of food orders. During events where customers walk up to the bar to place their orders, the tap view need not be used as drink orders can be fulfilled instantly.
