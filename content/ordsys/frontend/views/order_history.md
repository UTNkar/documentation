This view is read-only and does not allow any interaction with or modifications to the orders. It serves purely for informational purposes, enabling users to review past orders. This feature was added in response to user feedback requesting visibility into delivered orders, especially useful in situations where an order may have been mistakenly marked as delivered or when verifying recent order activity.
