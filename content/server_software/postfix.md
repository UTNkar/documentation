Sending e-mail on the UTN servers is done using the
[Postfix](http://www.postfix.org) software package. The software has been setup
on the servers in such a way that one can locally simply connect to `localhost`
on port 25 using the SMTP protocol. In the current configuration the servers
only send e-mail; mails send to any `utn.se` domain are handled by [Google
Apps](/infrastructure/google_suite).

The installation of Postfix on the servers is done using an
[Ansible](/development_tools/ansible) role. For more information about the
installation, see the Ansible repository.

### SMTP
In 2018, many emails failed to get delivered. This was solved by using the SMTP relay provided by Google Suite. This required some extra setup on the union's Google Suite. The setup can be found at the [Admin page](https://admin.google.com) for the Google Suite under `Apps -> Gsuite -> Gmail -> Advanced Settings`. On this site you should find `SMTP-relay service` under `forwarding`.
