This menu tab handles the different education programs and sections. If the
university adds a new study program or changes the name of an existing program
you might want to edit the programs in the system. If the Union adds a new
section or if they chose to change name you might want to edit the sections.

The menu tab Education contains two sub menus “Sections” and “Study program”.

### Sections

In the sections window you can see all added sections. To add a new section
click “ADD SECTION”. To edit a section hold the cursor over the one you want to
edit and click “EDIT”. You can delete old sections by holding the cursor over
the section you want to delete and click “DELETE”.

enter information about the section name and in studies you chose what studies
the students in that section belong to. All sections must have the alternatives
“PhD studies” and “Stand alone courses” selected.

In the study program window you can see all added study programs. To add a study
program click “ADD A STUDY PROGRAM”. To edit a study program hold the cursor
over the one you want to edit and click “EDIT”. You can delete old study
