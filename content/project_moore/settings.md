The menu “Settings” contain the administrative settings for the web page.

## Users

The sub menu tab “Users” contains a list of all users on the web page. It is
possible to manually add users but preferably the person that wants an account
creates it in the log in window.

### Add/edit users

The image below shows an example of adding/editing a user. Fill out all the
information and set the status as active. It’s better to set an old user as
inactive instead of deleting it. This way contact information to old students is
saved. When editing an existing user don’t change the password unless it’s
necessary. The member status will update automatically.

The Role tab is used to manually add a user in a group, when a user is added to
the group it gets the administrative rights for that group. If the recruitment
process is done as it is supposed the user automatically belongs to the group
during their term of office. In special cases a user can manually be added to a
group, be careful with this function since a manually added user never loses its
administrative rights unless removed.

At the top of the roles window is a check bock called “Administrator” if this
box is marked the user has full access to all parts of the system. This box must
be both manually activated and deactivated. Only persons who must have full
access should be administrators, such as the Information officer and System
administrator. If the user is administrator it has no effect if the user belongs
to a group or not.

## Groups

The sub menu groups handles the administrative rights for the officials in a
team/committee. These rights both decide what pages you are allowed edit and
what parts of the application system the user can use. When you enter the menu
you get a list of all existing groups and a button “ADD A GROUP”

When adding a page permission (any other than root) hold the cursor over the
permission and click “CHOOSE ANOTHER PAGE”. A small window appears with a list
of all pages on the website. Choose a page by clicking on it. If you don’t know
the name of the page, open a new browser tab, navigate to the page you intended
and click “show in explorer”. Here you can see the name of the page. For
documents and images just choose the collection in the drop down list. To add
multiple access to different pages and collection there is an “ADD
IMAGE/DOCUMENT/PAGE PERMISSION” for every alternative. Creates a new permission.

## Sites

This setting handles the different sites connected to UTN:s page. Here you can
see all existing sites and add additional sites. This feature does not create
pages on the UTN page it creates new websites. This should only be done by the
system administrator or the Information officer.

## Collections

Here you can see and add collections for images and documents. Make sure to give
proper names to the collections so it is clear if it’s a document or image
collection.

## Redirects

This setting handles redirects. This means that you can add a redirect from one
page of the system to any other page in the system or any URL. When you enter
the window you get a list of all active redirects and the alternative to add a
new redirect.

When adding or editing a redirect you choose from what page in the system you
want to redirect and which site it should be active on. If you want to redirect
to a page within the system click “CHOOSE A PAGE” or if it’s to an external link
enter the URL in the “Redirect to any URL” box.

## Social media accounts

In this setting you can edit the links to the Unions social media accounts. This
is most likely never relevant to do. These links appear as social media symbols
on the bottom of the page (not admin window).
