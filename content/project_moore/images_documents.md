All images and documents are stored under the two tabs Images and Documents.
Both Images and Documents work the same way and this instruction will show how
to add and manage pictures.

![Images Window](/images/moore/images.png)

When you enter the image window you will see something similar to the picture
above. Here you can find all images in the system. You can search by using the
search field and you can filter on different collections. Collections are
managed in the settings tab.

### Adding images

To add an Image click on the button “ADD AN IMAGE”. You will then enter the add
image window.

![Add Image](/images/moore/add_image.png)

When in the add image window you will see something similar to the picture
above. To add an Image from your computer you can either click on the “OR CHOSE
FROM YOUR COMPUTER” button or drag and drop a file. When the image is loaded it
will appear in the window together with a preview (See picture above). Next to
the preview you can change the name of the file, chose what collection it should
belong to and add tags. Make sure to give the picture a good name so it will be
possible to search for it later. Click save to add the image.

### Editing Images

When an image has been added you might want to edit it. Go back to the image
window and chose the image you want to edit by clicking on it.

![Edit Image](/images/moore/edit_image.png)

When editing an Image you will see a window similar to the picture above. Here
you can:

- See file size and dimensions
- Change title
- Change image file
- Change collection
- Edit/add tags
- Set focal point
- Delete the Image

The focal point decides how the image will be scaled when used in the rest of
the system. Set the focal point around the most important parts of the image.

### Editing documents

When a document has been added you might want to edit it. Go to the document
window and click on the document you wish to edit. (You can not edit content of
document)

In the edit document window you can:

- See file size
- Change title
- Change file
- Change collection
- Delete the document
- Edit/add tags
