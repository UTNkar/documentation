UTN utilizes [GitHub](https://github.com/) for version control of various projects. All UTN repositories are part of the [UTNkar organization](https://github.com/UTNkar) on GitHub, which is managed by the system administrator. Access to different projects within this organization can be granted to UTN contributors.

The UTN GitHub organization operates on the free plan, which includes unlimited collaborators without additional costs.

While some UTN projects can be made public to encourage community contributions and potentially enhance project quality, it's important to consider the likelihood of external use and ensure a quality product before making a repository public.

Version control for these projects is handled through [Git](https://git-scm.com). Basic knowledge of Git is necessary to work with these repositories. For those new to Git or preferring a graphical interface, tools like [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) can provide a more user-friendly experience.
