For any project that is enriched by version control, UTN has a repository on
[GitHub](https://github.com/). All these repositories are bundled in an
[organization](https://github.com/UTNkar). This organization is under the
control of the system administrator and access to various projects can be
granted to any contributor within UTN.
The github uses the free plan which allows for unlimited collaborators and does not add extra costs

Some projects can be made public, this might improve the quality of a project as
everyone is able to contribute to the project. However, note that some of these
projects are unlikely to be used publicly and that there must be quality of
product before publishing the project might be usable for others.

The version control in GitHub uses [Git](https://git-scm.com). A basic knowledge
of git is required to use the repositories. Starting in Git might be easier with
a GUI, if you like to use such a thing, take a look at either
[GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) or [GitHub
Desktop](https://desktop.github.com).
