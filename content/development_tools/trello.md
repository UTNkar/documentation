[Trello](https://trello.com/) is a system that is used to keep track of what needs to be done within the IT systems of UTN. The system self is simple enough. The IT board is divided in several sections:

- Ideas, things that someone thought of that might be implemented
- Maintenance, things that need to be done to keep the servers operational.
- Issues, things that are wrong at the moment and need fixing.

Preferably all card are tagged with the right labels and in case necessary are
equipped with a checklist of tasks to be completed. More complete descriptions
and other extras are always appreciated.

Once a card is being worked on, it is moved into the **I'm working on** list.
When waiting on replies or other external factors, move it to the **Waiting on
something** list. And if a task is completed move it to a list **Completed
[MONTH]** where **[MONTH]** is replaced by the current month. Once the tasks are
added to the UTN documents, lists of older months can be archived.
