**Everyone who drives bocken must sign an agreement!**

Agreements are handled in the admin pages. On the list view the admin can see all the added agreements and when they expire.
If an agreement has expired it will be colored red.

An agreement contains the following fields:
- **name:** The full name of the person
- **personnummer**
- **phonenumber:** The phonenumber to the person (in case they need to be contacted)
- **email:** The person's private email. It should not be an email ending in *@utn.se*. **Note** that not everyone has an email added.
This is because before this system was created, emails weren't collected so some of them are empty. When creating a new agreement though, emails are required.
- **expires:** The date when the agreement expires.
