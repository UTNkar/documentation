Journal entry groups are the groups that the user can choose when [adding an entry](/bocken_journal_system/user_views/adding_entries/).
The groups are created and managed in the admin pages. When the system is installed it comes with a predefined set of groups.

Each group belongs to a main group. This is to make it easier to find a specific group instead of having to scroll through all of them.
