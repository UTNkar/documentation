The digital journal system was created in the spring of 2021 by the then Head of the pub crew (klubbm√§stare).

Previously the journal for bocken was analog and you filled in a form on a piece of paper that existed in a folder in the car.
When it was time for the vice president of UTN to start billing all groups, they had to go through all those papers
and manually count how much each group had driven.

By making the journal system digital, that no longer is a burden and can instead be calculated instantly.
It also save a lot of paper since the forms no longer have to be printed out.
Also, by making it digital it becomes easier to get an overview of the journal and to prevent lost costs from appearing i.e. the journal was not filled in so we don't know who should pay for the journey.
