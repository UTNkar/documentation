UTN conducts its surveys using [LimeSurvey](https://www.limesurvey.org), which is an open-source survey software. This tool is primarily utilized by the *Studiesocialt ansvarig* (Study Social Responsibility Officer) at UTN. If you have any questions, please contact [soc@utn.se](mailto:soc@utn.se).

An account for the system administrator is maintained and handed over to each successive system administrator.
