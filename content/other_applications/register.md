The union uses a member registry called Melos which is managed by USMOS. It is a joint system used by
the nations and unions in Uppsala. Melos features an API for retreiving a user from the member registry
and checking if a person is a member of UTN or not. The system administrator has more details on how to use
this api. The information officer also has the ability to access the member registry.

Any information regarding Melos will soon be depricated due to an imminent switch to Upright
