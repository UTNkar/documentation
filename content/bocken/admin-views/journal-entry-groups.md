When you [add a journal entry](../user-views/adding-entries/), you'll select from various groups to categorize the entry. These groups are organized and maintained via the admin pages. The system is pre-equipped with a set of default groups.

Each group is part of a larger main group, simplifying the process of locating a specific group by avoiding the need to scroll through a long list.
