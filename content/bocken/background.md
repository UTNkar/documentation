The digital journal system for Bocken was developed in the spring of 2021 by the Head of the pub crew (klubbm√§stare) at that time.

Before the digital system, Bocken's journal was maintained on paper forms stored in a folder within the vehicle. The vice president of UTN had the cumbersome task of manually reviewing these paper entries to calculate billing for each group based on their usage.

The digital journal system has streamlined this process, enabling instant calculations of usage and billing. This not only reduces the time and effort involved in accounting but also cuts down paper usage, as there's no longer a need to print out forms. Additionally, the digital system improves the overall management of the journal, making it simpler to get an overview and reducing the risk of lost costs due to unrecorded journeys.
