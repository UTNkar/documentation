# What is the registration system?
The Union has a several events which require some sort of application and are typically associated with a raffle.
For this purpose, the Digitalization committee has developed a website aptly named the _registration system_.
It is intended to replace the old registration systems of the Puzzle Hunt Rally, The River Rafting event and
The Natural Science Ball. Polhacks is also expected to make the change, although not within the close future.

## Usage
The registration system is designed to allow site administrators (i.e each committees IT-responsible person)
to easily facilitate and manage application and distribution of event spots as needed by each respective event.
This is achieved by allowing users to submit applications, as well as create and manage their teams and payment.

## User flow
Users begin by submitting [raffle entries](./raffle_entry.md) to participate in the next raffle. From there the
site administrator can [give out spots](./give_out_spots.md) to raffle participators. Winners can [register an account](./accounts/_index.md),
which automatically forms a team for the user. The user can then invite other users to join their team.
Finally, users can [pay](./payment.md) for their team and participation through the website.
