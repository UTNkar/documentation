# Team overview
Team captains, i.e raffle winners who registered their accounts, can see their team overview
by logging in and navigating to `/overview`. The team leader can there edit the team information,
invite teammates, and edit other teammates information in the case they can not.

In the codebase, the team is represented by each team leaders

## Teammates
Team captains have access to the teams _invite link_. Sharing the invite link will allow anyone with the
link to create an account and join the team. If the users invite link is compromised, the team captain
can generate a new link, invalidating the old one.

Teammates (users which belong to a team but are _not_ the team captain) can log in and edit their own
information.
